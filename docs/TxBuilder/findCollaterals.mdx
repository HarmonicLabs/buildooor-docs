# `findCollaterals`

```ts
findCollaterals(utxos: UTxO[], targetCollateralLovelaces?: number | bigint): UTxO[]
```

Finds suitable UTxOs to use as collateral for transactions involving Plutus scripts.

## Parameters

- `utxos`: [`UTxO[]`](../cardano-ledger-ts/classes/UTxO) - Array of UTxOs to search through
- `targetCollateralLovelaces`: `number | bigint` - Optional target amount of Lovelaces for collateral

## Returns

Returns an array of [`UTxO`](../cardano-ledger-ts/classes/UTxO) instances that can be used as collateral.

## Info

This method finds UTxOs that:
1. Contain only ADA (no native tokens)
2. Have no datum hash
3. Have sufficient Lovelaces to meet the target amount
4. Are not locked by scripts

Collateral is required for transactions that include Plutus scripts. If script validation fails, the collateral is taken as a fee to compensate nodes for the execution costs. The method tries to find the minimum number of UTxOs that satisfy the target amount while meeting all collateral requirements.
