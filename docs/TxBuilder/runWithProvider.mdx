# `runWithProvider`

## method definition
```ts
runWithProvider( provider: Partial<ITxRunnerProvider> ): TxBuilderRunner
```

given a `Partial`\<[`ITxRunnerProvider`](../TxBuilderRunner%20API/IProvider#itxrunnerprovider)\>
returns a [`TxBuilderRunner`](../TxBuilderRunner%20API/TxBuilderRunner)

## The empty provider

`Partial` implies that none of the methods specified in 
[`ITxRunnerProvider`](../TxBuilderRunner%20API/IProvider#itxrunnerprovider) are really required.

a [`TxBuilderRunner`](../TxBuilderRunner%20API/TxBuilderRunner) instance will do its best to minimize calls to the provider;
that means that if all the data needed is already present (as in the case of the [`buildSync`](./buildSync) method)
the provider is not needed.

so an empty object (`{}`) is a valid provider.

## Pro and Cons of the empty provider

The advantage of using `runWithProvider` with an empty provider over using directly [`buildSync`](./buildSync)
is an even higher level interface to build transaction,
which might turn useful for complex transactions.

The disadvantages are that the [`TxBuilderRunner`](../TxBuilderRunner%20API/TxBuilderRunner)
methods might throw an error if some data that needs to be resolved (e.g. datum hashes or utxo references) is not present;

so you will have to make sure you resolve your utxos and datums.
