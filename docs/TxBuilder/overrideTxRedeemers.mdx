# `overrideTxRedeemers`

```ts
overrideTxRedeemers(tx: Tx, newRedeemers: TxRedeemer[]): Tx
```

Replaces the redeemers and clears vkeyWitnesses in the witness set and re-computes the scriptDataHash in the body.

## Parameters

- `tx`: [`Tx`](../cardano-ledger-ts/classes/Tx) - The input transaction to modify
- `newRedeemers`: [`TxRedeemer`](../cardano-ledger-ts/classes/TxRedeemer)[] - Array of new redeemers to replace existing ones

## Returns

[`Tx`](../cardano-ledger-ts/classes/Tx) - A new transaction with updated redeemers and cleared signatures

## Info

This method might be needed in some **rare** cases where the plutus script calculation is offset by some units.

The input transaction is readonly and is not modified. **A NEW TRANSACTION IS CREATED** with vkey witness set empty (the new transaction is unsigned).

The new transaction differs in:
1. `tx.body.scriptDataHash` - Re-computed based on new redeemers
2. `tx.witnesses.redeemers` - Replaced with provided redeemers
3. `tx.witnesses.vkeyWitnesses` - Cleared (empty)

:::warning The new transaction is unsigned

Empty vkeyWitnesses implies any signature present in the input transaction is discarded because the transaction body changed, so the signature would be invalid.

If you use this method make sure to request the user to sign the transaction **ONLY AFTER** modifying redeemers.
