# Getting Started

This getting started guide will walk you through all of the basics of using Buildooor,
from set up to submitting complex transactions with different validators.

The first step to following htis guide is to start an empty node project, everything else
will be included in the docs, from imports to scripts, so yo ucan grab snippets from
this documentation and they will work together seamlessly.

With Buildooor installed, the first thing you need to do is set up your `Provider` we will
use blockfrost for these examples, but you are able to use any others that you wish.

[Provider Example](/examples/Provider)

With Blockfrost set up we can start looking at some examples that will help get you up and
running with Buildooor.

Simple Transactions
Compiling Validators
Validator Transactions

For this guide we will need to generate a wallet and fund it, so we can run the 
transactions.

[Generating Wallets](/examples/GeneratingWallets)

Once you have your wallet, fund it from the Testnet Faucet -Link-, or send some test ADA from your wallet.

> NOTE:
> If you ar sending from your wallet, make sure you switch your wallet network to Pre-Prod.
> DO NOT send ADA on the Mainnet network.

Then we can start building and testing transactions.
