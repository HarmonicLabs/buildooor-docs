# `addRequiredSigner`

```ts
readonly addRequiredSigner!: (
    signer: Address | StakeAddress | AddressStr | StakeAddressBech32
) => TxBuilderRunner
```

- `signer`: [`Address`](../cardano-ledger-ts/classes/Address) |
[`StakeAddress`](../cardano-ledger-ts/classes/StakeAddress) |
[`AddressStr`](../cardano-ledger-ts/type-aliases/AddressStr) |
[`StakeAddressBech32`](../cardano-ledger-ts/type-aliases/StakeAddressBech32)

adds the **all** credentials of the address to the `requiredSigners` field of a [`Tx`](../cardano-ledger-ts/classes/Tx) instance.

only the signers included in that field are passed to a contract's `ScriptContext`.

that includes payment credentials and, if present, stake credentials.

if you have an address with both payment and stake credentials,
but wish only to include one of them, consider using  the [`addRequiredSignerKey`](./addRequiredSignerKey.mdx) method.

returns a reference to the same [`TxBuilderRunner`](./TxBuilderRunner).
