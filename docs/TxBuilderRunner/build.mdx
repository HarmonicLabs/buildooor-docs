# `build`

```ts
readonly build:() => Promise<Tx>
```

if any unresolved data was passed it is resolved via the provider passed;

if the method needed are not present on the provider throws an `Error`;

finalizes the [`TxBuilderRunner`](./TxBuilderRunner) instance,
so that it can be re-used for other transactions,
and returns a [`Tx`](../cardano-ledger-ts/classes/Tx) instance
