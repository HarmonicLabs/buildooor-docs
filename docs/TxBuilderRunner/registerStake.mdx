# `registerStake`

```ts
registerStake(
    delegator: CanBeStakeCreds,
    redeemer?: CanBeData,
    script_or_ref?: Script<PlutusScriptType> | CanResolveToUTxO
): TxBuilderRunner
```

Registers a stake address on the Cardano blockchain. This is required before a stake address can be used for delegation or rewards.

## Parameters

- `delegator`: The stake credentials to register
- `redeemer`: Optional redeemer for script stake credentials
- `script_or_ref`: Optional script or reference input for script stake credentials. Can be:
  - A Plutus script that will be included in the transaction's witness set
  - A UTxO reference that contains the script
  - A reference to a UTxO that will be resolved using the provider's `resolveUtxos` method

## Returns

Returns a reference to the same `TxBuilderRunner` instance for method chaining.
